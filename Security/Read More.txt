The cookie with a secure flag will only be sent over an HTTPS connection.(https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/securing-cookies-httponly-secure-flags/#gref)

1. Https Configuration on your local

Steps:

Create a folder named "crt" in C:\Apache2 directory
Add cert.conf and make-cert.bat files in it, i.e. C:/Apache2/crt directory 
Edit the cert.conf file with notepad ++
Locate all the {{ DOMAIN }} in the file and replace with your domain name
For example: {{ DOMAIN }} changed into ---> dso.mars.localhost.dso.pentalog.fr
Save the file 
Next, Run the make-cert.bat
Enter the domain name you provided, in our case --> dso.mars.localhost.dso.pentalog.fr then press Enter
No need to fill in the questions that follows, Ignore them by pressing Enter until it says press any key to continue
Next, a new folder will be automatically created in our "crt" folder i.e. dso.mars.localhost.dso.pentalog.fr folder
Open it and run the server.crt file
Then click on Install Certificate —  Ok — Choose Local Machine —  Next —  Choose Place all certificate in the following store — Select Trusted Root Certificate Authorities —  Click OK —  Next and Finish
Note: ** Since you have already configured your host file , you can skip this step
Next Open your host file as administrator in Notepad++ --> C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/host
Add a new line ----- > 127.0.0.1 dso.mars.localhost.dso.pentalog.fr

Save the file
Next Open C:\Apache2\conf\extra\developpment\mars.conf
Copy and Paste the VirtualHost with port 80 and add the following modifications:
Change port to 443
And add the following lines of code in it: 
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile "crt/dso.mars.localhost.dso.pentalog.fr/server.crt"
SSLCertificateKeyFile "crt/dso.mars.localhost.dso.pentalog.fr/server.key"
Ensure that LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so and LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so are uncommented in your apache httpd.conf file
Restart Apache
Test in your browser as follows:
*https://dso.mars.localhost.dso.pentalog.fr*
